# pom

This is a pomodoro timer that's a node cli!

### Oops.

> Clone the repo, then run `yarn install` and then `npm link` from the directory!

So this was in here, definitely don't run `yarn install`, run `yarn`, silly goose, and what was I talking about with `npm link`?!

---

Then run `pom`!

Then go, go, go!

### Whaaat!

Yeap, okay ... so ... also let's clean up the different package managers ... does ... ... wow, a) yes, `yarn link` works, and b) the log to the console is way better, I didn't know you could run `pkgmngr link "libraryName"` and it'd use that one instead! So like if I need to fork something in node_modules ... game-changer, anyway, moving on.

Todo: next set of instructions should have just one package manager, and include what the program does, lol.
